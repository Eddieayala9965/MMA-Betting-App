Growing up, my mother raised me and my older brotherby herself, working multiple jobs to provide everything. She isn't the biggest fan of fighting but still loves and supports me unconditionally. My best friend Johnny Perez and his wife Felicitas have been extremely impactful in my life. Their friendship, selflessness, mentorship and unconditional support have allowed me to pursue this dream. They are married and have a newborn child, and they both work full-time. With that being said, they have opened their home, along with their hearts, to me and my wife Vanessa, allowing me to pursue this dream. I cannot express how thankful I am to them both for what they have done for me and my wife. My in-laws Vickie and Paul Strother havehad a really big impact on my life. They have opened their home and hearts for me and they have supported mein so many ways. My biggest hero is my wife Vanessa. She has supported me through thick and thin. Fighting on the regional circuitisn't a great way to support a family, and the lifestyle isn't conducive to a glamorous lifestyle. We survive on love, and if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here.",

After the fight the guy I beat was totally demoralized that he got essentially spanked by a 15-year-old in his first fight and made the comment I wonder why I got in the ring with that boy. So the commentator heard this and called me Wonderboy. Also when I was a younger kid I'd sing and dance and my sisters then boyfriend would call me Stevie Wonder so somehow all this turned into Wonderboy. Yeah, kinda crazy."

It was my first tournament and I got caught in a bad spot and, not knowing what to do, my instant reaction was to pick the girl up and throw her on the ground... but that is an illegal move and got me removed from the competition. Of course, all my teammates and friends thought that was amusing that I did that and got myself DQed so everybody started calling me Piledriver.

I started training Jiu Jitsu with my dad, then I stopped due to the training sessions intensifying greatly and people at my school started saying that my body was looking ugly and that it looked like a muscular mans body. Then I also started dancing, I did presentations and everything. I started to notice that all of my friends were competing and I was only dancing, it was then that, with my parents persuasion, I started Judo to better my Jiu-Jitsu. I stood out with Judo, and moved to the capital of my state to train at a highly regarded Judo club at 14 years of age. I won some Brazilian championships, participated in Seletivas Olmpicas and Circuito Europeu but I injured myself a lot and decided to go back home and study.

        "When and why did you start training for fighting?": "When I was 16 I wanted to know how to protect myself, so I started training Krav Maga. From the start, I knew it is what I want to do in my life. After a few years I became a Krav Maga instructor myself. But I wanted to develop, so I started to study about martial arts and found out that the most versatile is MMA. I fell in love with that sport.",
        "What ranks and titles have you held?": "The biggest success was of course being KSW champion, but I know that the biggest achievements are still ahead of me.",
        "Do you have any heroes?": "My biggest idol is Martyna Wojciechowska, a very famous Polish traveler and journalist. In MMA, the first fighter that got me inspired was Cristiane Cyborg, then there were Gina Carano and finally, the amazing Ronda Rousey. I know those ladies may not like each other, but I admire and respect all of them a lot.",
        "What does it mean for you to fight in the UFC?": "When my first pro fight happened, there was no single female fighting for the UFC, so I didn't think I would be a part of the UFC in the future. When I first heard that the UFC will introduce the strawweight division, I knew I had to be a part of it. Finally, I am here but I know it is just the beginning. I know I have to put in a lot of hard work to prove myself. I cannot fully describe in words how happy I am.",
        "Did you go to college and if so what degree did you earn?": "I tried three times but never finished. At first, it was journalism that I studied for one year. Later, I spent a year and a half studying archeology, and finally, it was a half year of studying sports pedagogy. In fact, I was looking for a right way in my life and I found it in MMA.",
        "What was your job before you started fighting?": "My last job was Krav Maga instructor in United Krav Maga.",
        "Specific accomplishments in amateur competition?": "I do not have many amateur starts in my record. Just five Muay Thai fights and three MMA bouts. My biggest success as an amateur was definitely winning the Polish Cup in Muay Thai.",
        "Favorite Striking technique:": "I do not have favorite techniques. In MMA, every technique must be your favorite. And if you do not like some technique, you have to repeat it constantly until you like it."
